# Sonoma SDK for Xamarin

## For contributors

For now the solution builds only on Mac OS using `./build.sh` at root.
This will create nuget packages in the `output` folder.

For the documentation generator project, you have to use Windows and install the `SandCastle` tool at https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases/tag/v2016.9.17.0.
Then open the `Sonoma-SDK-Xamarin-Documentation` solution.
